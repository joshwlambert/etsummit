## Our pipeline

We propose the following pipeline to tackle this issue:

1. Explore the 2 datasets and try to understand them
2. Perform some cleaning and standardisation to get the 2 datasets at the same scale
3. Peform some descriptive statistics
4. Find variables or combination of variables that can be associated with the real dengue incidence using:
  
    * direct correlations
    * regression
    * PCA analysis
